I love coffee, watches, and tattoos. When I make coffee, I log every detail about it quantitatively and qualitatively.
For watches, I truly love to read about the mechanisms which describe how watches work. What gets me the most is how well engineered they are
to the point that there are so many watches older than me which still work perfectly.
For tattoos I love Horimono/Japanese tattoos. The themes I'm mostly in love with are Shinto-ism and how it ties with religion and folklore.
